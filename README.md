## 👨‍🏫 About Me

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering (MAME) at the University of Windsor. My work bridges the gap between theoretical control systems and practical industrial applications, with a focus on aerospace and intelligent manufacturing.

Before joining the University of Windsor in 2018, I worked as a Data Scientist and DPHM Analyst at **Pratt & Whitney Canada**. I hold a Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) and a B.Sc. from K. N. Toosi University of Technology.

I am a **Senior Member of IEEE**, a **Lifetime Member of AIAA**, and a registered **Professional Engineer (P.Eng.)** in Ontario.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research group focuses on the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and diagnostics for complex systems. Key areas include:

* **Fault Detection, Diagnostics, and Prognostics (FDD&P):** Model-based and data-driven approaches for safety-critical systems.
* **Aerospace Systems:** Control and diagnostics for satellites, UAVs, and aircraft subsystems (e.g., reaction wheels, control moment gyros).
* **Intelligent Manufacturing & Industry 5.0:** Integrating AI and computer vision to improve manual labor efficiency and production monitoring.
* **Multi-Agent Systems:** Cooperative control and formation flying for autonomous vehicles (drones, satellites).
* **Control Theory:** Linear and nonlinear controller/observer design (Kalman filters, Reinforcement Learning).
